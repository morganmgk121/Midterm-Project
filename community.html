  <h3><b>Swallow Hill Music</b></h3>
     
<p class= "one">Open stage at the Cafe Stage at least once a week, go join! Tell you family and friends! It is a great way to have fun with your friends and meet more of your close community members. An opportunity to get out of the house and experience something new and entertaining.
<br>  <br>        
Stay after, meet the band and enjoy a Swallow Hill Music concert with your family, a perfect Friday evening.   </p>
   
   
     <h5><b>Volunteer Opportunities</b></h5>
<p class= "two">With more than 300 concerts and events every year, plus year-round music school programming, Swallow Hill Music has become the largest organization of its kind west of the Mississippi. Such a prolific organization thrives because of its volunteers!
        <br>
        <br>

We are currently looking for volunteers to help with our concerts. This is a great opportunity to be a part of our community and experience some of the fantastic music that Swallow Hill Music has to offer.
<br><br>
Concert volunteers must be at least 18 years old and available Friday and Saturday evenings from 6:30pm until after the show ends, usually around 11pm. Primary volunteer responsibilities include: working in the caf√©, ushering Member sections, taking tickets at the doors, selling artist merchandise and assisting staff at Will Call.  </p>
